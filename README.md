<h1 style="color: #4cc9f0;"> ðŸ“Š  Data Visulation Project </h1>

In this repom, I did data analysis and data visualization projects by servicing R language.

It consists of two projects. In my first project, you will see the use of Barplot, Histogram and Boxplot for Data visualization. 

In my second project, you will see all the simple mathematical operations for Data Analysis and the top levels such as Cross products, covarience. You will also see the Scatterplot matrix example.

<h2 style="color: #4cc9f0;"> Features </h1>

- R 
- Clean Code

<h2 style="color: #4cc9f0;"> Lessons Learned </h1>

R is a programming language used in areas such as statistical calculations, data analysis, graphic drawings and data visualization. 

Unlike the software languages I use in my other projects, R is the interpretive and functional programming language. I can even compile the small piece of code you wrote. ( regardless of the entire code ) 

Since it is a functional programming language, it allows us to perform high level vector operations. 

It should definitely not be preferred for beginners.
